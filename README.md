# AG Challange in C++

**This is my miniproject in C++, Genetic Algorithm**

As part of the task, you must write your own Genetic Algorithm (AG) method. AG is used to find the best possible solutions to optimization problems. This task is a programming task, it is not intended to show the entire spectrum of possible applications of AG.

This task, for teaching purposes related to the TEP course, will be limited to solving the problem of optimizing branchless flow in backbone computer networks and the reliability of this flow.

A method called the Genetic Algorithm is used to search for good-quality solutions to problems such as the binary knapsack problem. The main idea of its operation is to create a population of randomly selected solutions. Then, in accordance with the idea of evolution, we choose better quality solutions and cross them with other good quality solutions. We hope that since the parents were of good quality, perhaps their offspring will be even better.
